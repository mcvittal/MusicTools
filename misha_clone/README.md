# MISHA clone

This software replicates the input module section of Eventide's new Misha Eurorack synth module. 

It maps out to my hardware Roland synth but this can be easily modified to work with Microsoft's built in GM synth or some other hardware synth through mido. 


Use the M key to start and stop sustain mode, and space to stop sustain on the current note. 

Currently mapped in a V much like Misha:



1: -4               6: +4  
 q: -3             t: +3  
  a: -2           f: +2  
   z: -1   x: 0  c: +1  


It operates on a key listening subroutine thread so it will operate even when the command window is not active.

Press ESC to quit from the application.
